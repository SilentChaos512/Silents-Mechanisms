### Changed
- Updated more textures (futurenp)
### Fixed
- Wires not connecting to some blocks (more work needed) [#62]
- Drying rack not interacting with some item transfer methods (missing item handler capability) [#55]

## [0.6.12] - 2020-01-21
### Removed
- Some old recipes leftover from earlier versions. These were left in-place because ores were added later on.
### Changed
- Many textures (machines and crafting items mostly) by Futurenp

## [0.6.11] - 2019-12-31
### Added
- Temporary texture for hand pump
- Russian translation (Smollet777)
### Removed
- "Inventory" text from machine screens [#41]
### Changed
- Increased zinc and bismuth defaults to 4 veins per chunk and vein size of 8 (you will need to update your config file to get these changes) [#58]
- Fluid fuel generators (lava, diesel) now consume 100 mB (configurable) of fuel at once. This will reduce lag, but will decrease fuel efficiency when power demand is low. [#48]
    - Consider using CC Tweaked computers to control generators for better efficiency.
- Mixer will no longer put the same fluid in different tanks [#24]
### Fixed
- Ethane and polyethylene buckets missing fluid capability (not working with Refined Storage) [#49, #41]
- Pump not allowing fluids to be extracted [#43]

- Wire model incorrect when connecting to block below [#51]
- Ethane and polyethylene are now properly flagged as gaseous (I think) [#49]
- Ore gen master switch config being ignored

## [0.6.9] - 2019-11-20
### Added
- Ethane and polyethylene buckets, for compatibility reasons. These buckets cannot place these fluids as blocks, as the blocks do not exist. [#49, #41]
### Fixed
- Upgrades affecting comparator output level on machines [#47]
- Lava generator not accepting lava canisters via hoppers [#46]
- Machine frame blocks rendering oddly underwater [#32]

## [0.6.8] - 2019-11-04 
### Added
- Config to set chance of oil lakes (can be disabled by setting to 0)
### Changed

### Fixed
- Battery box bottom texture [#40]

## [0.6.6] - 2019-10-20
Significant rewrite of wire code to fix several issues. Watch for bugs!
### Added
- Crusher recipes to create dusts from ingots
### Changed
- Wires now store a small amount of energy (related to [#35, #36])
### Fixed
- Wires creating stack overflows when interacting with Useless Mod energy cables [#35, #36]

## [0.6.5] - 2019-10-12
### Added
- Crusher recipe for RF Tools Base's dimensional ore
- Advancement translations (thanks xMGZx) [#31, #17]
- Drying racks occasionally emit smoke particles when working
### Changed

- Standard tier machine speed to 2.0x (up from 1.5x)
- Drying rack can be waterlogged (will not function when waterlogged)
- Set minimum Forge version to 28.1.5
### Fixed

## [0.6.4] - 2019-10-10
### Added
- Diesel generator. Produces 120 FE/t, 10 ticks/mB (1.2M FE per bucket).
### Fixed
- Added missing electrum recipes [#27]
- Added missing textures for new metal blocks

## [0.6.3] - 2019-10-05
This update finally completes the plastic production process! All recipes are visible in JEI, as always.
### Added
- Solidifier, a machine that takes one liquid and outputs items. Recipes can be added with data packs.
- Recipe to make plastic pellets from polyethylene (solidifier)
- Recipe to make ice from water (solidifier)
- Recipes to upgrade basic alloy smelters and crushers
- Recipes for most machine upgrades (may change)
- Platinum (with ore), enderium, signalum, and lumium (support for Solar Generation)
### Changed
- Oil lakes are now slightly more common in desert biomes
### Fixed
- Lava generator missing its loot table [#26]
- Other missing loot tables (also added a warning system so the game will yell at me when I forget more in the future)
- Might fix another wire-related crash [#23]

## [0.6.2] - 2019-10-01
### Added
- Mixer, combines up to four fluids into one. Recipes can be added via data packs, as with all other machines.
### Fixed
- Possibly fixed wire placing crash [#23]
- Divide by zero crashes [#22]
- Silent Lib not being correctly listed as a dependency in the mods.toml

## [0.6.1] - 2019-09-27
### Added
- Canisters, stackable fluid containers (64 per slot). This will hold any fluid, but probably won't be recognized by other mods.
    - Fluid color is currently pulled from some JEI code until I write my own solution. If you report colorless fluids in canisters I will make fun of you :p
- Pump, picks up fluids from the world. Can fill buckets or canisters. Requires some FE to work
- Refinery is working
- Refinery can fill buckets or fluid canisters
- Temporary refinery textures
- Plastic pellets and sheets (not craftable yet, we're getting there...)

## [0.6.0] - 2019-09-23
Even more recipe work!
### Added
- Machine upgrades. Not craftable yet, but 3 of the 4 are functioning. Most machines (except basic ones) will have upgrade slots. Only one upgrade is allowed in each slot, but they can stack elsewhere.
- Oil, generates in "lakes", usually underground. No function at the moment.
- Diesel, will be one product of refining oil. Currently no way to produce it.
- Refinery, not functional. Will refine oil into other fluids. Has a "recipe" system which will allow mods or datapacks to use it.
### Changed
- Coal generator now also accepts `forge:nuggets/coal` [#18]
### Fixed
- Ores generating in wrong generation stage [#19]
- Add loot table for basic crusher

## [0.5.2] - 2019-09-08
More recipe progression/rebalancing, more to come
### Added
- Basic crusher
- Coal dust
- Advancements (names and descriptions missing)
### Changed
- Steel-like ingot recipes now require coal dust (meaning you need a basic crusher)
### Fixed
- Crash when opening machines [#14]
- Coal generator being uncraftable with new recipe progression [#13]
- Lava generator not accepting lava if output slot is empty [#12]
- Add loot table for basic alloy smelter

### Added
- Basic alloy smelter
- ComputerCraft computers can now get and set the redstone mode on machines
### Changed
- Rebalanced some recipes, more to come
### Fixed
- Actually added steel recipe this time
- Lava generator consuming lava buckets when full

## [0.5.0] - 2019-08-30
Updated for Forge 28.0.74+
### Added
- Lava Generator. Creates Forge Energy from lava (anything in the `minecraft:lava` fluid tag). Should interact with fluid pipes from other mods (not tested yet), or you can place lava buckets into its input slot.
    - Yes, the model is broken and the textures are temporary!
    - Currently generates 500K FE per lava bucket (feedback appreciated)
- Steel recipe [#9]
- ComputerCraft (CC Tweaked) computers can now read energy levels of machines and generators
### Changed
- Generators can now be controlled by redstone like machines (defaults to ignore redstone)
- Coal generator now accepts only coal and charcoal (`minecraft:coals`) and coal blocks (`forge:storage_blocks/coal`) by default. Override the `silents_mechanisms:coal_generator_fuels` item tag if you need to change this.

## [0.4.2] - 2019-08-24
### Added
- Machines can now be controlled by redstone (defaults to ignore redstone). Does not work on generators yet, expect it next update.
- Machine frames (no use yet), Electrum
### Changed
- Machines are now set to their inactive state (and lose progress) when they run out of power
### Fixed
- Alloy smelter matching the wrong recipes

## [0.4.1] - 2019-08-23
### Added
- Wrench item. Rotates some blocks and sets the connection type of wires
- Wires are now implemented. They still require some work, but are usable.
### Changed
- Updated Polish translation (Dolores_McDoodle)
### Fixed
- Blocks losing their inventory when broken [#4]

## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-22

- Metal blocks and nuggets
- Zinc, bismuth, brass, bismuth brass, aluminum (bauxite), and uranium
### Changed
